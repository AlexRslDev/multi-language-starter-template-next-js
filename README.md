# Next.js 16 + Tailwind CSS 4 + Typescript Ultimate Starter

This is a professional, pre-configured template designed to save you hours of initial setup. It includes everything you need for modern, scalable applications with global support right out of the box.

## Why use this template?

Configuring language handling and dark mode in Next.js is often repetitive and error-prone. This template does it for you:

* **Next.js 16 (App Router):** Cutting-edge performance and React Server Components.
* **Tailwind CSS 4:** The evolution of design with simplified configuration and increased speed.
* **Multi-language (i18n):** Robust internationalization system already integrated into routes and components.
* **Dark/Light Mode:** Seamless implementation, without flashing, and with persistence in LocalStorage.
* **Clean Structure:** Optimized folder organization for scaling projects.
